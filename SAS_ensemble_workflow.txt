# SAS Workflow:
# 1. Specify file paths, etc
#    1.a. Directory file structure
#    1.b. List of files
# 2. Specify constants & parameters
#    2.a. SAS-specific
#    2.b. settings & parameters from ED2IN
#    2.c. parameters from XML
#    2.d. parameters from ED2 code
# 3. Extract site-level values, set up blank data objects
#    3.a. derived values & indices
#    3.b. Set up patch matrix
#    3.c. Soil layers
# 4. Find mean soil temp & moisture 
#   *** PLACE TO GET VALUES TO GENERATE ENSEMBLE ****
#    -- uses analy files
# 5. Cohort Extraction Loop
#    - Cohort Columns:
#       1. year   = first year for next set of runs (yeara)
#       2. patch  = number age slice we're working with
#       3. cohort = cohort number extracted from file
#       4. dbh    = dbh values extracted from file ("DBH")
#       5. ht     = height values extracted from file ("HITE")
#       6. pft    = pft identity extracted from file ("PFT")
#       7. n      = density extracted from file ("NPLANT")
#       8. bdead  = dead biomass (heartwood) extracted from file ("BDEAD")
#       9. balive = living biomass (sapwood, leaves, etc) extracted from file ("BALIVE"
#      10. Avgrg  = BLANK! (no clue what this actually is)
#    - Also fills some basic values into patch file
#       1. site  = 1
#       2. year  = restart year 
#       3. patch = number of age slice
#       4. dst   = 1 (no clue what this is)
#       5. age   = time since spin start 
#       -- plus dummy values
# 6. Patch Extraction Loop (from monthly histo files)
#    - fsc_in = fast (labile?) soil C inputs ("FSC_IN")
#    - ssc_in = structural (recalcitrant?) soil C inputs ("SSC_IN")
#    - ssl_in = structural (recalcitrant?) soil L inputs ("SSL_IN")
#    - fsn_in = fast (labile?) soil Nitrogen inputs ("FSN_IN")
#    - pln_up = plant nitrogen uptake inputs ("TOTAL_PLANT_NITROGEN_UPTAKE")
# 7. Calculate steady-state soil pools!
#    7.a. calculate A_decomp (depends on decomp_scheme)
#         7.a.1 Temperature Limitation
#         7.a.2 Moisture Limitation
#    7.b. Steady-State Pool calculation
#         7.b.1. Carbon & fast Nitrogen pools
#         7.b.2. Mineralized nitrogen calculation
#    7.c. Place values in pss file
# 8. Write file!
